By analyzing this data, decision-makers can make informed strategic choices to maximize revenue.



2️⃣ 𝐒𝐚𝐥𝐞𝐬 𝐛𝐲 𝐑𝐞𝐠𝐢𝐨𝐧: To gain a global perspective, I've designed a captivating map showcasing sales performance by region. This interactive feature allows executives to delve into the company's sales distribution worldwide, identify top-performing regions, and spot potential growth areas.



3️⃣ 𝗦𝗮𝗹𝗲𝘀 𝗯𝘆 𝗣𝗿𝗼𝗱𝘂𝗰𝘁 𝗖𝗮𝘁𝗲𝗴𝗼𝗿𝘆: To better understand product performance, I've incorporated a dynamic bar chart or donut chart that illustrates the sales contribution of different product categories. Executives can easily identify the top-performing categories and allocate resources accordingly to drive further success.



4️⃣ 𝗣𝗿𝗼𝗱𝘂𝗰𝘁 𝗣𝗲𝗿𝗳𝗼𝗿𝗺𝗮𝗻𝗰𝗲: Understanding the pulse of product performance is crucial. Hence, I've included a table or bar chart presenting the best-selling products based on sales quantity or revenue. This valuable information aids executives in making data-driven decisions about inventory, marketing, and future product development.



5️⃣ 𝗣𝗿𝗼𝗱𝘂𝗰𝘁 𝗣𝗿𝗼𝗳𝗶𝘁𝗮𝗯𝗶𝗹𝗶𝘁𝘆: Maximizing profitability is a top priority for any business. To assist in this endeavor, I've created a visually appealing heatmap or treemap that showcases the profitability of different products based on profit margin and sales volume. This insightful feature empowers executives to focus their efforts on the most lucrative products.



6️⃣ 𝗞𝗲𝘆 𝗖𝘂𝘀𝘁𝗼𝗺𝗲𝗿𝘀: Identifying and nurturing key customer relationships is essential for long-term success. My dashboard includes a table or bar chart displaying the top customers based on sales revenue or order frequency. This information helps executives understand their most valuable customers and tailor their strategies accordingly.



7️⃣ 𝗦𝗵𝗶𝗽𝗽𝗶𝗻𝗴 𝗖𝗼𝘀𝘁𝘀: Efficient shipping management is crucial to maintain profitability. I've incorporated comprehensive shipping cost analysis tools, including a stacked bar chart or area chart that highlights shipping costs by region or transportation method.
